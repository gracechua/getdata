Code book for github.com/gracechua/getdata

This code book describes the variables in the tidy data set.
You should at this point have the original Samsung data set. 

This tidy data set describes the average of each of several measurements, for each of six activities that 30 subjects took part in. 

Each person carried out each of six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a samsung Galaxy S-II smartphone on the waist. The phone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope captured data on linear acceleration and angular velocity in three axes, X, Y, and Z. 

mean -  refers to the mean value for a measurement
std - refers to the standard deviation for a measurement

-XYZ is used to denote signals in three axes, X, Y, and Z. 

tBodyAcc-XYZ - body acceleration signal 
tGravityAcc-XYZ - gravity acceleration (XYZ)
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ - body linear aceleration signal derived to get jerk signal
tBodyGyro-XYZ - gyroscope signal
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ - gyroscope jerk signal
tBodyAccMag - body acceleration magnitude
tGravityAccMag - gravity acceleration magnitude
tBodyAccJerkMag - body acceleration jerk magnitude
tBodyGyroJerkMag - gyroscope jerk magnitude

Fast Fourier transform was applied to these signals; f indicates frequency domain signals.
